// 🔧 Booking & Planning

// 1. How do I book a stag party with DXB Stag Parties?
// Our platform is designed for easy online booking. Browse experiences or packages, select your preferences, and book everything directly through the website — no waiting, no back-and-forth.
// If you have questions or need help, our team is available via WhatsApp or email, and a concierge can assist you.
// For a next-level service, you can book a dedicated stag concierge or chaperone who will act as your on-site fixer and personal planner. This premium service comes at an additional cost but guarantees a stress-free weekend.

// 2. Can I customise a package or build my own itinerary?
// Yes. You can either start with a themed package and tweak it, or build your own lineup from scratch using our activities. Our system handles it all online — or contact us if you need assistance.

// 3. Do I have to pay for the full group upfront?
// No. Our system allows individual payments so each group member can pay their share. You can also assign costs to specific guests (like splitting the groom’s share).

// 4. Can we add or remove people after booking?
// Yes, as long as it’s within the supplier’s change window. Just reach out and we’ll adjust your group size if availability allows.

// 5. Is there a minimum group size?
// Most activities require a minimum of 4–6 people. Premium packages like yachts or exclusive lounges may require 8–10 minimum. Each listing shows the required group size.

// 💳 Payments & Deposits

// 6. What’s the payment process?
// Once you choose your experiences, payment is made online at checkout.
// We don’t offer refundable holds — payment is required to confirm any booking.
// For last-minute or VIP-level requests, we offer an Express Concierge option at a cost, which includes personal planning, express handling, and a dedicated stag manager.

// 7. How do individual payments work?
// When you confirm a booking, each guest receives a personal payment link. Everyone pays their share securely, and the organiser can track who’s paid.

// 8. Can we pay in a different currency?
// Prices are listed in AED, but we accept all major international cards. Your bank will handle the conversion automatically.

// 9. Can we split the groom’s cost across the group?
// Yes. During checkout, you can choose to divide the groom’s share across everyone else. Our system handles the math for you.

// 🕶 The Weekend Itself

// 10. Where do we meet for each activity?
// Your final itinerary will include all meeting points, contact info, and arrival times. It’s sent to the organiser and each group member before the weekend.

// 11. Do you provide transport between activities?
// Yes — you can add transport options like private vans, limos, or even party buses during booking. Let us know if you want an upgrade.

// 12. Can we drink alcohol at all activities?
// Only at licensed venues (clubs, bars, restaurants, yachts). Alcohol is not permitted at public desert activities or sports zones.

// 13. What happens if we’re late?
// Late arrivals may result in shorter sessions or missed experiences. Suppliers have different grace periods — check your itinerary and stay punctual!

// 🏖 Dubai-Specific Info

// 14. Is it legal to have a stag party in Dubai?
// Yes — Dubai welcomes groups, but there are rules. Public nudity, extreme drunkenness, or disorderly behaviour can get you fined or worse. Keep the wildness to private venues, and you’re good.

// 15. Are there dress or behaviour restrictions?
// Yes, especially in public. No offensive costumes, no toplessness, and no swearing at strangers. In private venues, you can relax — but stay respectful.

// 16. Can we bring alcohol ourselves?
// Yes — tourists can now purchase alcohol legally from licensed retailers by presenting a passport. You’ll be registered in-store and granted a temporary license.
// Bars, clubs, and restaurants still serve alcohol freely to tourists. Just don’t drink in public or bring your own alcohol into unlicensed areas.

// ⸻

// 🔄 Changes & Cancellations

// 17. Can we cancel activities after booking?
// Each supplier has a cancellation policy, typically allowing cancellations 7–14 days, some are 30 days, in advance. Inside that window, charges may apply.

// 18. What if someone drops out?
// We can adjust the group size if enough notice is given, though late changes may still incur charges depending on the supplier.

// 19. Can we reschedule?
// Yes — if requested early enough. Late reschedules may be treated as cancellations depending on supplier availability and timing.
